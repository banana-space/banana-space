Hooks provided by the MonoBook skin.

'MonoBookAfterContent': Called after div#content has been closed but right
before div#column-content is closed. You can use this to inject items (such as
ads, for example) from an extension.

'MonoBookAfterToolbox': Called in toolbox() after the toolbox portlet (div#p-tb)
has been generated. You can use this to inject items (such as ads or a hit
counter, for example) from an extension.
This is the MonoBook couterpart to the VectorAfterToolbox hook in the Vector
skin.

'MonoBookTemplateToolboxEnd': DEPRECATED. Called by Monobook skin after toolbox
links have been rendered (useful for adding more). Note: this is only run for
the Monobook skin. To add items to the toolbox you should use the
SkinTemplateToolboxEnd hook instead, which works for all "SkinTemplate"-type
skins.
$tools: array of tools
