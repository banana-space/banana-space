'CairoContent' => '`CairoContent` is used to describe the content that a surface will contain, whether color information, alpha information (translucence vs. opacity), or both.

Note: The large values here are designed to keep `CairoContent` values distinct from `CairoContent` values so that the implementation can detect the error if users confuse the two types.',
'CairoContext' => 'Context is the main object used when drawing with cairo. To draw with cairo, you create a `CairoContext`, set the target `CairoSurface`, and drawing options for the `CairoContext`, create shapes with functions . like `CairoContext::moveTo` and `CairoContext::lineTo`, and then draw shapes with `CairoContext::stroke` or `CairoContext::fill`. Contexts can be pushed to a stack via `CairoContext::save`. They may then safely be changed, without losing the current state. Use `CairoContext::restore` to restore to the saved state.',
'CairoException' => '`Exception` class thrown by `Cairo` functions and methods',
'CairoFillRule' => 'A `CairoFillRule` is used to select how paths are filled. For both fill rules, whether or not a point is included in the fill is determined by taking a ray from that point to infinity and looking at intersections with the path. The ray can be in any direction, as long as it doesn\'t pass through the end point of a segment or have a tricky intersection such as intersecting tangent to the path. (Note that filling is not actually implemented in this way. This is just a description of the rule that is applied.)

The default fill rule is `CairoFillRule::WINDING`.',

New features may be added to `CairoFontOptions` in the future. For this reason `CairoFontOptions::copy`, `CairoFontOptions::equal`, `CairoFontOptions::merge`, `CairoFontOptions::hash` (cairo_font_options_copy(), cairo_font_options_equal(), cairo_font_options_merge(), and cairo_font_options_hash() in procedural way) should be used to copy, check for equality, merge, or compute a hash value of `CairoFontOptions` objects.',
'CairoFontSlant' => 'Specifies variants of a font face based on their slant.',
'CairoFontType' => 'CairoFontType class is an abstract final class that contains constants used to describe the type of a given `CairoFontFace` or `CairoScaledFont`. The font types are also known as "font backends" within cairo.

The type of a CairoFontFace is determined by the how it is created, an example would be the `CairoToyFontFace::__construct`. The `CairoFontFace` type can be queried with `CairoFontFace::getType` or `cairo_font_face_get_type`

The various `CairoFontFace` functions can be used with a font face of any type.

The type of a `CairoScaledFont` is determined by the type of the `CairoFontFace` passed to `CairoScaledFont::__construct` or `cairo_scaled_font_create`. The scaled font type can be queried with `CairoScaledFont::getType` or `cairo_scaled_font_get_type`.',

'CairoHintStyle' => 'Specifies the type of hinting to do on font outlines. Hinting is the process of fitting outlines to the pixel grid in order to improve the appearance of the result. Since hinting outlines involves distorting them, it also reduces the faithfulness to the original outline shapes. Not all of the outline hinting styles are supported by all font backends.',

'CairoOperator' => 'This is used to set the compositing operator for all cairo drawing operations.

The default operator is `CairoOperator::OVER`

The operators marked as unbounded modify their destination even outside of the mask layer (that is, their effect is not bound by the mask layer). However, their effect can still be limited by way of clipping.

To keep things simple, the operator descriptions here document the behavior for when both source and destination are either fully transparent or fully opaque. The actual implementation works for translucent layers too. For a more detailed explanation of the effects of each operator, including the mathematical definitions, see http://cairographics.org/operators/.',

'CairoStatus' => '`CairoStatus` is used to indicate errors that can occur when using Cairo. In some cases it is returned directly by functions. but when using `CairoContext`, the last error, if any, is stored in the object and can be retrieved with `CairoContext::status` or `cairo_status`. New entries may be added in future versions.

Use `Cairo::statusToString` or `cairo_status_to_string` to get a human-readable representation of an error message.',

   guarantees that either all or none of its statements will be executed.
   This behavior is achieved by writing a batch log on the coordinator,
   which slows down the execution somewhat.
 * `Cassandra::BATCH_UNLOGGED` - this batch will not be verified when
   executed, which makes it faster than a `LOGGED` batch, but means that
   some of its statements might fail, while others - succeed.

the risk of reading stale data. This policy will retry in the same scenarios as
the default policy, and it will also retry in the following case:

  required by the current consistency level then retry with a lower
  consistency level
* On a write timeout, Retry unlogged batches at a lower consistency level

Other loops than the current one are fine, however. The rationale behind this is that one don\'t need to check for recursion in those watchers, i.e. the sequence will always be: `EvPrepare` -&gt; blocking -&gt; `EvCheck` , so having a watcher of each kind they will always be called in pairs bracketing the blocking call.

An added event remains in *pending* state until the registered event occurs, thus turning it to *active* state. To handle events user may register a callback which is called when event becomes active. If event is configured *persistent* , it remains pending. If it is not persistent, it stops being pending when it\'s callback runs. `Event::del` method *deletes* event, thus making it non-pending. By means of `Event::add` method it could be added again.',

Note, that if whoever calling `EvLoop::fork` calls it in the wrong process, the fork handlers will be invoked, too.',
'EvIdle' => '`EvIdle` watchers trigger events when no other events of the same or higher priority are pending ( `EvPrepare` , `EvCheck` and other `EvIdle` watchers do not count as receiving *events* ).

Thus, as long as the process is busy handling sockets or timeouts(or even signals) of the same or higher priority it will not be triggered. But when the process is in idle(or only lower-priority watchers are pending), the `EvIdle` watchers are being called once per event loop iteration - until stopped, that is, or the process receives more events and becomes busy again with higher priority stuff.

Apart from keeping the process non-blocking(which is a useful on its own sometimes), `EvIdle` watchers are a good place to do *"pseudo-background processing"* , or delay processing stuff to after the event loop has handled all outstanding events.

The most noticeable effect is that as long as any *idle* watchers are active, the process will *not* block when waiting for new events.',
'EvIo' => '`EvIo` watchers check whether a file descriptor(or socket, or a stream castable to numeric file descriptor) is readable or writable in each iteration of the event loop, or, more precisely, when reading would not block the process and writing would at least be able to write some data. This behaviour is called *level-triggering* because events are kept receiving as long as the condition persists. To stop receiving events just stop the watcher.

The number of read and/or write event watchers per fd is unlimited. Setting all file descriptors to non-blocking mode is also usually a good idea(but not required).

Another thing to watch out for is that it is quite easy to receive false readiness notifications, i.e. the callback might be called with `Ev::READ` but a subsequent *read()* will actually block because there is no data. It is very easy to get into this situation. Thus it is best to always use non-blocking I/O: An extra *read()* returning `EAGAIN` (or similar) is far preferable to a program hanging until some data arrives.

If for some reason it is impossible to run the fd in non-blocking mode, then separately re-test whether a file descriptor is really ready. Some people additionally use `SIGALRM` and an interval timer, just to be sure thry won\'t block infinitely.

Always consider using non-blocking mode.',
'EvLoop' => 'Represents an event loop that is always distinct from the *default loop* . Unlike the *default loop* , it cannot handle `EvChild` watchers.

Having threads we have to create a loop per thread, and use the *default loop* in the parent thread.

The *default event loop* is initialized automatically by *Ev* . It is accessible via methods of the `Ev` class, or via `EvLoop::defaultLoop` method.',
'EvPeriodic' => 'Periodic watchers are also timers of a kind, but they are very versatile.

Unlike `EvTimer` , `EvPeriodic` watchers are not based on real time(or relative time, the physical time that passes) but on wall clock time(absolute time, calendar or clock). The difference is that wall clock time can run faster or slower than real time, and time jumps are not uncommon(e.g. when adjusting it).

`EvPeriodic` watcher can be configured to trigger after some specific point in time. For example, if an `EvPeriodic` watcher is configured to trigger *"in 10 seconds"* (e.g. `EvLoop::now` + `10.0` , i.e. an absolute time, not a delay), and the system clock is reset to *January of the previous year* , then it will take a year or more to trigger the event (unlike an `EvTimer` , which would still trigger roughly `10` seconds after starting it as it uses a relative timeout).

As with timers, the callback is guaranteed to be invoked only when the point in time where it is supposed to trigger has passed. If multiple timers become ready during the same loop iteration then the ones with earlier time-out values are invoked before ones with later time-out values (but this is no longer true when a callback calls `EvLoop::run` recursively).',
'EvPrepare' => 'Class EvPrepare

EvPrepare and EvCheck watchers are usually used in pairs. EvPrepare watchers get invoked before the process blocks,
EvCheck afterwards.

It is not allowed to call EvLoop::run() or similar methods or functions that enter the current event loop from either
EvPrepare or EvCheck watchers. Other loops than the current one are fine, however. The rationale behind this is that
one don\'t need to check for recursion in those watchers, i.e. the sequence will always be: EvPrepare -> blocking ->

Also, EvCheck watchers should not activate/feed events. While libev fully supports this, they might get executed

'EvSignal' => '`EvSignal` watchers will trigger an event when the process receives a specific signal one or more times. Even though signals are very asynchronous, *libev* will try its best to deliver signals synchronously, i.e. as part of the normal event processing, like any other event.

There is no limit for the number of watchers for the same signal, but only within the same loop, i.e. one can watch for `SIGINT` in the default loop and for `SIGIO` in another loop, but it is not allowed to watch for `SIGINT` in both the default loop and another loop at the same time. At the moment, `SIGCHLD` is permanently tied to the default loop.

If possible and supported, *libev* will install its handlers with `SA_RESTART` (or equivalent) behaviour enabled, so system calls should not be unduly interrupted. In case of a problem with system calls getting interrupted by signals, all the signals can be blocked in an `EvCheck` watcher and unblocked in a `EvPrepare` watcher.',
'EvStat' => '`EvStat` monitors a file system path for attribute changes. It calls *stat()* on that path in regular intervals(or when the OS signals it changed) and sees if it changed compared to the last time, invoking the callback if it did.

The path does not need to exist: changing from "path exists" to "path does not exist" is a status change like any other. The condition "path does not exist" is signified by the `\'nlink\'` item being 0(returned by `EvStat::attr` method).

The path must not end in a slash or contain special components such as `\'.\'` or `..` . The path should be absolute: if it is relative and the working directory changes, then the behaviour is undefined.

Since there is no portable change notification interface available, the portable implementation simply calls *stat()* regularly on the path to see if it changed somehow. For this case a recommended polling interval can be specified. If one specifies a polling interval of `0.0 ` (highly recommended) then a suitable, unspecified default value will be used(which could be expected to be around 5 seconds, although this might change dynamically). *libev* will also impose a minimum interval which is currently around `0.1` , but that’s usually overkill.

This watcher type is not meant for massive numbers of `EvStat` watchers, as even with OS-supported change notifications, this can be resource-intensive.',
'EvTimer' => '`EvTimer` watchers are simple relative timers that generate an event after a given time, and optionally repeating in regular intervals after that.

The timers are based on real time, that is, if one registers an event that times out after an hour and resets the system clock to *January last year* , it will still time out after(roughly) one hour. "Roughly" because detecting time jumps is hard, and some inaccuracies are unavoidable.

The callback is guaranteed to be invoked only after its timeout has passed (not at, so on systems with very low-resolution clocks this might introduce a small delay). If multiple timers become ready during the same loop iteration then the ones with earlier time-out values are invoked before ones of the same priority with later time-out values (but this is no longer true when a callback calls `EvLoop::run` recursively).

The timer itself will do a best-effort at avoiding drift, that is, if a timer is configured to trigger every `10` seconds, then it will normally trigger at exactly `10` second intervals. If, however, the script cannot keep up with the timer because it takes longer than those `10` seconds to do) the timer will not fire more than once per event loop iteration.',

*Motivation*: Suppose we need to refer to a document in another collection. The easiest way is to create a field in the current document. For example, if we had a "people" collection and an "addresses" collection, we might want to create a link between each person document and an address document: Linking documents people; $addresses = $db->addresses; $myAddress = array("line 1" => "123 Main Street", "line 2" => null, "city" => "Springfield", "state" => "Vermont", "country" => "USA"); // save the address $addresses->insert($myAddress); // save a person with a reference to the address $me = array("name" => "Fred", "address" => $myAddress[\'_id\']); $people->insert($me); ?> ]]>

Then, later on, we can find the person\'s address by querying the "addresses" collection with the `MongoId` we saved in the "people" collection.

Suppose now that we have a more general case, where we don\'t know which collection (or even which database) contains the referenced document. `MongoDBRef` is a good choice for this case, as it is a common format that all of the drivers and the database understand.

If each person had a list of things they liked which could come from multiple collections, such as "hobbies", "sports", "books", etc., we could use `MongoDBRef`s to keep track of what "like" went with what collection: Creating MongoDBRef links selectCollection("people"); // model trains are in the "hobbies" collection $trainRef = MongoDBRef::create("hobbies", $modelTrains[\'_id\']); // soccer is in the "sports" collection $soccerRef = MongoDBRef::create("sports", $soccer[\'_id\']); // now we\'ll know what collections the items in the "likes" array came from when // we retrieve this document $people->insert(array("name" => "Fred", "likes" => array($trainRef, $soccerRef))); ?> ]]>

Database references can be thought of as hyperlinks: they give the unique address of another document, but they do not load it or automatically follow the link/reference.

GridFS is a storage specification all supported drivers implement. Basically, it defines two collections: `files`, for file metadata, and `chunks`, for file content.

Each document in the files collection contains the filename, upload date, and md5 hash. It also contains a unique `_id` field, which can be used to query the chunks collection for the file\'s content. Each document in the chunks collection contains a chunk of binary data, a `files_id` field that matches its file\'s `_id`, and the position of this chunk in the overall file.

For example, the files document is something like: 123456789, "filename" => "foo.txt", "chunkSize" => 3, "length" => 12); ?> ]]> and the chunks documents look like: 123456789, "n" => 0, "data" => new MongoBinData("abc")); array("files_id" => 123456789, "n" => 1, "data" => new MongoBinData("def")); array("files_id" => 123456789, "n" => 2, "data" => new MongoBinData("ghi")); array("files_id" => 123456789, "n" => 3, "data" => new MongoBinData("jkl")); ?> ]]> Of course, the default chunk size is thousands of bytes, but that makes an unwieldy example.',

'SessionHandler' => '`SessionHandler` is a special class that can be used to expose the current internal PHP session save handler by inheritance. There are seven methods which wrap the seven internal session save handler callbacks (open, close, read, write, destroy, gc and create_sid). By default, this class will wrap whatever internal save handler is set as defined by the session.save_handler configuration directive which is usually files by default. Other internal session save handlers are provided by PHP extensions such as SQLite (as sqlite), Memcache (as memcache), and Memcached (as memcached).

When a plain instance of `SessionHandler` is set as the save handler using `session_set_save_handler` it will wrap the current save handlers. A class extending from `SessionHandler` allows you to override the methods or intercept or filter them by calls the parent class methods which ultimately wrap the internal PHP session handlers.

This allows you, for example, to intercept the read and write methods to encrypt/decrypt the session data and then pass the result to and from the parent class. Alternatively one might chose to entirely override a method like the garbage collection callback gc.

Because the `SessionHandler` wraps the current internal save handler methods, the above example of encryption can be applied to any internal save handler without having to know the internals of the handlers.

To use this class, first set the save handler you wish to expose using session.save_handler and then pass an instance of `SessionHandler` or one extending it to `session_set_save_handler`.
