MediaWiki phan configuration
============================

`src/config.php` is the standard base phan configuration for MediaWiki
projects. You can include that file in your project and extend/modify
it as you see fit.

See <https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Continuous_integration/Phan> for
more details.
