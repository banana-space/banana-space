SecureLinkFixer

This MediaWiki extension rewrites external links to use the HTTPS protocol
if they are on the HSTS preload list.

While users with modern browsers will automatically use HTTPS, outdated
browsers or non-browser clients will first try visiting HTTP before being
redirected to HTTPS.

This extension is licensed under the GPL v3, or any later version. The HSTS
list included with this extension (domains.php) is licensed under the
Mozilla Public License, v 2.0.
