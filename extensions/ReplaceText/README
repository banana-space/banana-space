== Overview ==

Replace Text is an extension to MediaWiki that creates a new special page,
Special:ReplaceText, available to anyone who has the 'replacetext'
privilege, that does a text find-and-replace on all pages in the wiki,
selectable by namespace. Both the contents of pages and their titles can be
modified. The search is case-sensitive.

Since the replacement is not undoable, if the replacement string is
blank or a string that is already contained in the wiki, the 'ReplaceText'
page prompts the user to confirm the replacement before it is performed.

Each replacement shows up as a wiki edit, with the administrator who
performed the replacement appearing as the user and an edit summary that
looks like "Text replacement: 'search string' to 'replacement string'".

For more information, see the extension homepage at:

== Requirements ==

This version of the Replace Text extension requires MediaWiki 1.23 or higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'ReplaceText' directory
within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add either of the
following lines to your 'LocalSettings.php' file:

     wfLoadExtension( 'ReplaceText' );
     require_once( "$IP/extensions/ReplaceText/ReplaceText.php" );

In order to perform replacements, you must have the 'replacetext' permssion;
if you are an administrator on your wiki, the easiest way to do this is to
also add the following line:

     $wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['replacetext'] = true;

== Contact ==
