The CategoryTree extension provides a dynamic view of the wiki's category
structure as a tree. It uses AJAX to load parts of the tree on demand.

The CategoryTree extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in
2006 and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). The
internationalization files contain contributions by several people;
they are mentioned in each file individually. Also thanks to Tim Starling
for his contributions.
