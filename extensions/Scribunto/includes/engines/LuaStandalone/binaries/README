The lua binaries were compiled from a manually patched 5.1.5 source tree, in order
to address security vulnerabilities reported in CVE-2014-5461.

The Windows binaries were compiled statically and do not link against the Visual C++
runtime libraries. They should function on Windows 7 and higher, and Windows Server
2008 and higher.

The Linux binaries were compiled using "make generic". Lua does not use
autoconf, rather it encourages users to edit the makefile. The makefile patch
used to create the Linux binaries is in generic.patch.

Compiling with "make generic" avoids introducing dynamic library dependencies
other than libc. This makes the binaries work on a far greater variety of Linux
distributions.

issue: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T72541
