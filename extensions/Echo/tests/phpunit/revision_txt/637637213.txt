==RFC: ''Alleged'' theft of cigars from convenience store?==
{{archivetop|result=Consensus is fairly clearly against using "alleged". [[User:Number 57|<font color="orange">Number</font>]] [[User talk:Number 57|<font color="green">5</font>]][[Special:Contributions/Number 57|<font color="blue">7</font>]] 12:36, 10 December 2014 (UTC)}}
In references here to the theft and/or strong-arm robbery of cigars from a convenience store prior to the shooting of the decedent, should this article use the term ''alleged'' or ''allegedly'' before any such claims since the decedent was never and will never be charged or convicted of theft or robbery? <span style="font-family: Gill Sans MT, Arial, Helvetica; font-weight:100;">[[User:Dwpaul|<font color="#006633">Dwpaul</font>]]</span> <sup>''[[User talk:Dwpaul|<font color="#000666">Talk  </font>]] ''</sup> 02:52, 29 November 2014 (UTC)

*(As nom) '''Yes''', as that is Wikipedia's standard practice when a criminal act is alleged but will never be prosecuted. <span style="font-family: Gill Sans MT, Arial, Helvetica; font-weight:100;">[[User:Dwpaul|<font color="#006633">Dwpaul</font>]]</span> <sup>''[[User talk:Dwpaul|<font color="#000666">Talk  </font>]] ''</sup> 02:54, 29 November 2014 (UTC)
* '''no''' There is video of the event. An admission from his friend who was present, and admission from the Brown family. We actually have numerous opposite examples of non-convicted persons who are described as having done certain illegal actions, and we have hundreds of reliable sources saying without qualification that brown took the Cigars without paying. However, describing that theft in a specific legal crime term should not be done as we do not have sufficient proof that all elements of a crime were done, it is enough to say "stole cigars" or "took cigars without paying" but not "committed robbery" etc. [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 03:00, 29 November 2014 (UTC)
:: In regard to the question whether there is "sufficient proof that all elements of a crime were done", we just need to follow the MO law. It says, "[http://law.justia.com/codes/missouri/2013/title-xxxviii/chapter-569/section-569.030/ A person commits the crime of robbery in the second degree when he forcibly steals property.]" Did he steal the items? Did he use force when confronted by the clerk? If you say yes to both questions, then all elements of the crime were done and the act is called robbery in the second degree. [[User:Z22|Z22]] ([[User talk:Z22|talk]]) 01:08, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

*'''No''' per Gaijin42 above and also see Columbine Shooting, Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting,, Isla Vista Killings and numerous other articles here on WP where a crime has been committed with the individual being killed and/or suicide with no prosecution and/or conviction and the word alleged is not used in those articles. I would also note that the police have classified this case as being "exceptionally cleared", a stringent standard to meet in a case when there will be no prosecution or conviction.[[User:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue"> '''''Isaidnoway''''' </font>]][[User talk:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">'''''(talk)'''''</font>]] 03:04, 29 November 2014 (UTC)
*'''No''' - Alleged refers to something that is said, without proof, to have taken place or done. Also, by the same logic of Dwpaul, you cannot identify someone for a criminal act if they are incapable of being tried. Glad to know that despite the Columbine Shooting evidence that you are content to put "alleged", again a reference to "unproven", in front of any act or attribution of the killers. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 05:52, 29 November 2014 (UTC)
:::Didn't say you "cannot identify someone for a criminal act"; simply said you should make clear you are not claiming they have been ''convicted'' of it, if only for your own protection (in this case, for the protection of the project). That is all ''allegedly'' does. <span style="font-family: Gill Sans MT, Arial, Helvetica; font-weight:100;">[[User:Dwpaul|<font color="#006633">Dwpaul</font>]]</span> <sup>''[[User talk:Dwpaul|<font color="#000666">Talk  </font>]] ''</sup> 06:05, 29 November 2014 (UTC)
:::: We are not "convicting" anyone. Your understanding of "alleged"'s use is wrong according to the dictionary. Allegations in a legal sense are no different, but you should be aware of that process. Since this is not a pending court matter so kindly take your armchair lawyering off this page. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 06:31, 29 November 2014 (UTC)

*'''No.''' According to [[WP:ALLEGED]], alleged is ''"appropriate when wrongdoing is asserted but undetermined, such as with people awaiting or undergoing a criminal trial."'' In this case, Brown will never go to trial so the issue won't be determined that way. However, we are not entirely without the ability to make an editorial determination here. We have a published security video showing what certainly appears to be a theft (or more accurately strong arm robbery) and there is the published testimony of Brown's friend Johnson describing the events in the store. That description supports that it was in fact a strong arm robbery. In addition, many (though not all) sources refer to the event as a theft and do not use the term "alleged". Taking all this into consideration, I think it's perfectly reasonable, neutral and accurate to treat it as an actual crime and leave out he word "alleged".

:There have been theories suggesting that maybe Brown did pay for the cigars and the clerk just wanted an ID. This is an interesting theory, but entirely unsupported by ''anything''. Others note that no store employee contacted the police (a customer did). In no way does this cause other evidence to vanish. Again, taking ALL things into consideration from what is available to us, it is reasonable to say that a crime was committed and there is nothing "alleged" about it. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 22:11, 29 November 2014 (UTC)

::That actually brings up an interesting question. Let's suppose Brown (who is of age) wants to buy cigars and the clerk wants to see an ID. Let's further suppose Brown throws down the money and says "screw the ID, here's the money" then grabs the cigars and leaves. The clerk tries to stop him still wanting to see the ID. Brown pushes past and exits the store (we'll forget about the hard shoving). Has a crime been committed? Or more specifically, is it theft? &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 22:36, 29 November 2014 (UTC)

:::If for some reasons you put a million dollars cash on the counter but the clerk refuses to "sell" an inexpensive product (no matter what it is) and you take that product anyway, then you use force to clear your way out of the store, you will still be charged with robbery in the second degree as per [http://m.willworshamlaw.com/Criminal-Defense-Home/Robbery.aspx MO law]. Even when give a correct amount of money to the clerk for the cigar, but the clerk refuses to sell that to you. The transaction does not take place. When you take valuable propety from that store when you have not been the owner of that property yet, it is stealing. To add to that, you use force, it's a robbery of the second degree.

:::: What a poor example - the discussion below shows it is closed and why. Original research or other accusations carry no real weight because the official report ''is'' our proper source.

[[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 05:06, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

*'''No''' – In prior weeks there was some question from news sources whether Brown might have actually paid for the cigarillos, that analysis seems to have disappeared even in Brown-friendly news outlets as more information has come out. Also, [[John Wilkes Booth]] did not "allegedly" assassinate Abraham Lincoln, even though he was never convicted of it. —[[User:Megiddo1013|Megiddo1013]]  01:49, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

* '''No''' - In the absence of any other reasonable explanations for what can be seen in the footage and testimonies, it seems safe to go with what the recently written RSs say on this one.  [[User:AdventurousSquirrel|AdventurousSquirrel]] ([[User talk:AdventurousSquirrel|talk]]) 12:56, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

* '''No''' - There's really no question at this point of what happened, and Brown is very much dead and thus we have no reason to worry about prejudicing a jury against him. It is safe to not use "alleged" here as we have video, testimony from his friend, RSs which don't use "alleged", and standard Wiki policy that in cases like this that we don't use it ([[John Wilkes Booth]], [[Columbine shooting]], ect.). [[User:Titanium Dragon|Titanium Dragon]] ([[User talk:Titanium Dragon|talk]]) 15:18, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

*'''COMMENT''' Due to the apparent [[WP:SNOW]] above, I am going to remove the "allege"s that are referring to the robbery. However, the RFC remains open, and consensus could certainly swing the other way over the next days/weeks. [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 15:25, 30 November 2014 (UTC)

:::::From the Missouri Uniform Crime Reporting Program (Missouri State Highway Patrol):
:::::Exceptional Clearance - If <u>all</u> four of the following questions can be answered 'Yes' the offense can be cleared “exceptionally”.

:::::# Do you know who the offender is?
:::::# Has the investigation determined there is enough information to support an arrest/charge of a specific individual?
:::::# Is the location of this individual known so the subject could by taken into custody now?
:::::# Is there some reason outside law enforcement‟s control that precludes arresting, charging, and prosecuting the offender?

:::::Examples of exceptional clearances include: death (suicide or justifiable homicide where the offender is killed by a police officers or citizen).

== Offensive Phrasing -- Style Question ==

Under the section Grand Jury Hearing (which should be capitalized, but I don't have editing privileges), it refers to the grand jury's makeup as "three blacks". This usage of black as a noun is not considered acceptable any longer in American English and is specifically prohibited in most style guides (I don't know if this is covered in wikipedia's).  <small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/38.108.125.200|38.108.125.200]] ([[User talk:38.108.125.200|talk]]) 19:01, 1 December 2014 (UTC)</small><!-- Template:Unsigned IP --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

:Isaidnoway is correct, but there is no requirement to match the specific source on something like this, which is not within a quotation.

{{out}} Navel gazing is where you are desperate to find some major significance in a hopelessly insignificant detail of life.  Imagine staring intently into your navel, and then you find a piece of lint and want to show your special insight to the world.  That was an apt metaphor for your silly comment, in which you made an observation about extremely reasonable & accurate use of language & wondered aloud whether it wasn't actually the reasonableness or accuracy, but NAY SIRS, HIDDEN RACISM, that made us decide to be reasonable and accurate.  If you don't see how that is at once both unconstructive & essentially impossible to discuss in connection with this WP article & insulting to other editors, and thus that there was no good reason to put it on the talk page, then I'm not sure what else to say.  Then again, judging by your username and userpage — and the comment "Racism is a core element of this issue" — it's pretty clear you are just trolling.  So I guess the joke's on me.

Back to the original question, while some of this can certainly be explained by the bias, or narrative the authors (of the RSs) wishes to tell, or political correctness, one must also remember that Columbine happened in school by and at attendees of that school, which makes the "boy" appellation a bit more contextual.[[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 16:12, 7 December 2014 (UTC)

== Shooting scene ==

I made some edits to the shooting scene section. It's longer.

I expanded the description of the street and indicated the directions in which the people involved were traveling. I added "left side" for those in right hand drive countries. I reorganized the evidence from three groups to two, anchoring the groups around the SUV and Brown's body, because the center group consists of one sandal.

The contentious part of my edit is those ten shell casings. I didn't know they were ''there'' until I saw the diagram. At first I thought it had to be a mistake. I tried to be NPOV about it, but I don't have a good reference about those casings. It has to be mentioned, though.

People (bystanders, parties involved, responders, investigators, etc.) move casings around crime scenes often, apparently. Sometimes it's inadvertent, or people take them as a souvenir, but sometimes people take them or move them simply to make things difficult for investigators, or in the worst case people might move them to make it look like a gun was fired in a different place. So, it's possible that the ten casings near Brown were put there to make it look like Wilson had shot Brown at close range.

Please don't reply with wikilawyering, fellow editors. Change whatever you want, add references, but this is not original research or speculation or whatever. The article needs a diagram. The diagram shows 10 casings in an unusual place. Those 10 casings have to be explained, and the only way to explain them without invoking a conspiracy theory is that they were moved. We can't say how, we can't say when, we can't say by whom, but they must have been moved because all the other evidence points that way. Somewhere in the transcripts or in some article I haven't read there is a clear, solid explanation of how they got there. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 22:27, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

:What are you talking about? They are there because they are near where wilson was standing at the time those shots were fired (plus random physics bounces and the like). There were other cops and media on the scene within seconds/minutes. When exactly do you think things were tampered with?

Where do you think those casings "really belong"?[[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 22:32, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

:Presumably from the blood stain at the far right, at some point Brown was standing near there during some of the shots. (with a fudge factor for how far blood may fly from being hit). Most of the witnesses, and Wilson say that they were about 20ft apart at that point. Wilson and some witnesses say that Brown moved forward, and Wilson says he was trying to backpedal to keep distance (while firing). . That explains the pattern of casings and blood fairly well to me, and more importantly, its all covered by reliable sources.

Having spent quite a bit of time working on the diagram, I can say that I was confused by the casings as well. Nothing nefarious, there though.

Thanks for not just reverting the whole edit. I'll explain:

''This placement of casings supports the claim that shots were fired in close proximity to Brown.''

I wanted to remind the reader of the early accounts that have Wilson walking up to Brown as he's laying on the pavement and shooting him. I wanted to say that in a neutral way. It's not really disputed that shots were fired in fairly close proximity, so I worded it that way.

''However, shell casings can be moved either inadvertently or in a deliberate attempt to confound or manipulate the investigation of a crime scene.''

This does not require a reference, and it's naive to think the presence of police or media makes a difference, especially considering there were specific requests for assistance regarding the crowd of people who gathered at the scene.

''The grand jury's interpretation cannot be known, but their decision not to indict Wilson suggests they concluded that the casings had been moved.''

I didn't want to say that the position of the casings was "unexplained," because I know there's an explanation, and I was sort of hoping someone would find that explanation and put it in the article. What I meant to say is that their decision not to indict does mean that they were convinced that Wilson did not execute Brown at close range. (The "without invoking a conspiracy theory" above means that we assume the jury decided in accordance with the evidence.) "They concluded the casings had been moved" was a plainly a bad choice of wording on my part. It's totally impossible to be objective, neutral '''and concise''' if people assume content is politically charged, but what I meant is "the decision not to indict Wilson means that they did not think he shot Brown multiple times while he was lying on the ground."

I should apologize for the above assertion that the casings must have been moved. However, the shell casings shouldn't be used to establish the locations where shots were fired.

Some of the casings directly south of the body are where they should be, but the ones to the east are up to 20 feet from what I take to be Wilson's easternmost point. Casings from a .40 cal [[SIG Sauer P229]] are ejected to the right and go slightly forwards or backwards. There are no casings in the area the west of the body, and there probably should be.

Last thing: My interpretation of "reliable source" forbids me from citing a politically biased journalist that interprets a primary source for me. Objective facts from a primary source are not original research, and synthesis of objective facts ''when only one conclusion is possible'' is not speculation. It's badly worded, but the decision not to indict means the jury believed that Wilson accurately described where he shot from.

{{od}}
If you have a non-reliable source that discusses a theory, you can bring it up here. We can't use it in the article, but it can certainly be a launching point for finding better sources.

Assuming any particular scenario, particularly one that involves tampering with the scene when there were dozens of eyewitnesses, media, and additional cops (not to mention Wilson himself) within seconds/minutes and nobody mentions anything close to that, on any side of the issue,  is absolutely something that requires sourcing

While your conjecture that ""the decision not to indict Wilson means that they did not think he shot Brown multiple times while he was lying on the ground." is true, it is absolutely the type of thing that requires sourcing. We do not put thoughts/words into living people's heads. Ever.

* You say "where only one conclusion is possible" but there are MANY possible conclusions.Here are a few I can think of in just a few minutes. I'm sure they are many more others could come up with. None of them should be discussed or hinted at without reliable sourcing.
** Wilson could have been that far and moved backwards. (Wilson and witnesses testify to this one)
** Brown could have had significant forward momentum as he fell putting his body in front of the casings
** Wilson could have been further to the right side of the road (down on the diagram) so was shooting at an angle and not parallel to the road. Therefore "ejection to the right" would be further down the road
** MOST guns eject back and to the right, but 20-30% of  bullet cases even from those guns go somewhere else, and in a particular gun if the ejector has been modified or bent or something could be consistently sending cases in a different direction
** If Wilson was [[Limp wristing]], or shooting with the gun tilted (either gangsta style, or canted up or down), or one handed, or any one of infinite shooting positions, it could have  significantly affected the trajectory

Also, I would suggest changing the identification to "Blood on the exterior and interior of the driver’s side front door", and we should include a reliable source for the blood on the car door. --[[User:Bob K31416|Bob K31416]] ([[User talk:Bob K31416|talk]]) 17:31, 5 December 2014 (UTC)

The "red stains" at the scene were confirmed to be blood by the crime lab. It's not original research to synthesize those pieces of information.
Please do not refer to publicly available information that was presented to the grand jury as "grand jury evidence." Only the transcripts of the hearing have been released, and nothing else can be released. Much of the evidence, such as photographs and audio recordings, is not public. The original map, if I remember correctly, was part of the medical examiner's office report. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 19:40, 5 December 2014 (UTC)

Thanks Cwobeel and Gaijin42 for the links, which were very helpful.

*Regarding the distance discussed previously — Here’s a source  and excerpts that refer to the grand jury proceedings, which I think would justify our highlighting the  distance from the blood to the body by showing it in the diagram.
::http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1411/25/ath.01.html :

::"They asked in great detail about the blood spatter evidence, which indicated that Michael Brown walked -- or may have indicated -- that walked back or ran back. There was blood further on down the line. His body ended up being 20 feet closer to Officer Wilson.”

::"But it was the questions on pages 87 and 88 -- and I'm sure you can find these on CNN.com if you want to pore through them yourselves -- the grand juror asks questions of the detective trying to nail down what Mark and Sunny and you guys were just talking about: This physical evidence of blood and the blood pattern and whether or not this blood pattern establishes the distance that Michael Brown traveled when he charged at the officer. And so the grand juror asked this, 'So as far as physical evidence, we have the blood on the ground. That was about 21 or 22 feet from where Michael ground ended up.’ “

:So I think the diagram is OK indicating this distance because it’s a notable distance.

*Regarding the red stains on the car I suggest,

:1. moving the red dots that are for the red stains on the car, to halfway overlap the car boundary, so as not to appear that they are on the ground. (Note this is the style used in this source [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/ferguson-missouri-town-under-siege-after-police-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=b-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=3].)

== Grand jury hearing section ==

The grand jury hearing section has, as far as I can tell, only one statement by a law professor in MO. To get an accurate idea of whether the hearing was out-of-the-ordinary, it's got to be compared to other police-involved-shooting cases in the same state.

I made some changes to the table. I know this makes it different than the Times' table, and it incorporates facts about grand juries from [[Grand juries in the United States]]. According to [http://www.stlouiscopa.com/Divisions.aspx?ID=151 this page from the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney,] "a little less than half" of the felony cases in the county result in a grand jury hearing and the others go to a judge for a preliminary examination. So this is not a "typical" MO grand jury case.

I also removed a statement about witnesses being repeatedly asked about whether Brown appeared to reached for a gun "despite the fact that it was known he was unarmed." The Times has legitimate concerns about the grand jury hearing which are in the article, but this claim is faulty. In the last seconds of Brown's life, he knew he didn't have a gun, but nobody else did. That emerged later.

Disclaimer: I hope that Wilson went through essentially the same process as any other officer, and I hope he had faced the same likelihood of being prosecuted. I deplore abuse of power, whether it's a court making an example of a person or a police officer using excessive force. But if the people of MO feel there is a need for change, it's a matter for the legislature, not the criminal courts. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 17:12, 5 December 2014 (UTC)

:Since the source didn't use those words — and since prosecutors, like Wilson, did not know at the time of the incident that Brown was unarmed — this sounds like obvious BS.

== Release of video in lead & dispatch ==

It seems to me that the fourth paragraph in the lead may be a little incomplete. At some point a dispatch went out mentioning the theft and Wilson claims this dispatch was something he considered before and during the altercation. Yet the only thing mentioned in the fourth paragraph is that some were pissed off about the release of the video and that it may shed light on Brown's state of mind at the time. I think this is an imbalance and should be briefly addressed, though I'm not entirely sure how.

== publisher= ==

When standardizing refs in this article, I have dropped any {{para|publisher}} and replaced it with {{para|website}}. While many editors use {{para|publisher}}, they generally use it incorrectly per the documentation, which states: ''The [[publisher]] is the company that publishes the work being cited. Do not use the publisher parameter for the name of a work (e.g., a book, encyclopedia, newspaper, magazine, journal, website).''

While you can code both {{para|website}} and {{para|publisher}}, I haven't felt that the latter is of enough use to the readers of this type of article to be worth the trouble and space. In many cases it would be a non-trivial task to determine the name of the publisher.

I just noticed that the copy-and-paste "template" we have in the comments at the top of the References section includes {{para|publisher}}, and I'm writing this as the explanation for my removal of that. &#8209;&#8209;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#8E8278;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 02:00, 6 December 2014 (UTC)

Micheal Brown attacked Officer Wilson there, as well as resisted arrest, so there's really no question that it is the scene of at least ''some'' crime committed, regardless of whether or not Wilson committed any crime.

== Incident reports ==

I changed the incident report section. The complaints are really examples of journalists writing about how they think people should do their jobs; if this incident report isn't different than a normal one ''about the same thing'', then it's not lacking in information.

The reason why the incident reports have very few details is that they are admissible in court. Filling in only basic information is a normal thing to do in a case like this, because the incident report is just the beginning of an investigation. In most cases, such as a collision involving a police vehicle, the incident report is a full description of the event because nothing more ever needs to be said about it. These incident reports are not the official story of the police department, they're the individual account of the person who might have to go to trial. Journalists should have known better than to speculate that details were being omitted improperly.

Something was made of the date of the report (ten days after the shooting); this is the time the report was ''entered.'' The date it was ''submitted'' isn't there. The times of day must also not mean what they appear to mean, since other accounts have police arriving at the scene in much less than 40 minutes.

Please don't tell me how Wikipedia works, even if it's using WP:article links to things that are not policy. I changed the section to describe the level of detail on the forms, and mentioned that Wilson sought legal advice about completing them. I kept the ACLU statement, because it is important to convey that people objected to the way the forms were completed, but I didn't keep the paraphrased list of things the HuffPo author thought were missing.

Reporting the Huffington Post author's opinion of how police departments should fill out incident reporting forms is not NPOV.

[…] Yesterday, in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU, the St. Louis County police released an incident report that says, in effect, nothing other than the time and proximate location of a homicide and the victim`s name, Michael Brown. That incident report indicates that it was not filed until possibly 10 days after the killing of Michael Brown.

In recent years, it has become customary for the police lawyer to run in, police union lawyer usually, and prevent the shooter from giving any kind of comment or writing any sort of incident report whatsoever. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/55915749/ns/msnbc/t/last-word-lawrence-odonnell-thursday-august-st/#.VIXbR6YqjoA|title= The Last word with Lawrence O'Donnell August 21, 2014|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=8 December 2014}}</ref> }}

:[[User:Cwobeel|Cwobeel]], Here’s some comments on your recent edits of the section.

::1) The first sentence of your version misstated the source. O'Donnell was referring to only the Ferguson incident report. The info was already in the first sentence that you moved.

::2) The second sentence of your version about Lisa Bloom’s opinion misstates the source. Lisa Bloom didn’t say that Wilson refused to file a report.

::3) Re the 3rd sentence of your version about Jim Cavanaugh’s comment — The info  was already covered in the first and second sentences of the original version.

::4) The 4th sentence of your version about the Ferguson police not filing an incident report was the original 1st sentence.

::5) The 5th and last sentence of the lead paragraph of your version was about a use-of-force report and was formerly the last sentence of the section. I hadn’t worked on the placement or content of this sentence yet.

::6) The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of your version were obtained by switching the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the original version. I hadn’t worked on the content or placement of the material in these paragraphs yet.

I mean, how blatant can you be? You removed a key piece: {{talkquote|. Brown stumbled, stopped, put his hands up and said "OK, OK, OK, OK, OK." The worker believed Brown had been wounded.

:It's difficult to contribute anything at all if every aspect of every edit has to be justified. The fact that somebody said that something happened is not necessarily worth reporting here, and it does not remain worth reporting here. Editing material that was written some time ago is not destructive, it's just changing the article to represent the importance of that particular account ''as of right now.''

:The construction worker's account describes Brown being hit from behind after being shot by one of three police officers. I thought it was acceptable to keep the broader details of the account. I did not remove all of the details in the "key piece" above. I only removed what the otherwise-unreliable account said Brown was saying. There's a reason for that. If someone reported that Brown said "I'm gonna kill you," then that conveys to readers the idea that Brown may have said that. Similarly, including a quotation from a possibly unreliable account, a quotation that other accounts don't include, can alter the opinions of readers in a different way than a retelling of what the worker said the people did. The edited account still conveys the worker's contention that Brown was trying to surrender, it just doesn't quote Brown in the retelling.

== Fair use photos of Michael Brown and Darren Wilson ==

I'm wondering about grabbing some photos of Brown and Wilson and uploading them as fair use. I have in mind these... [http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_33/614086/140812-michael-brown-1338_8c5ad41dd423c28ed02e37e39222844e.jpg Brown],[http://i97.photobucket.com/albums/l217/Shockwave_73/Album%202/Darren-Wilson_zps70a1888c.jpg Wilson], and using them in a manner similar to the ones in [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin]]. Brown is dead so "historic portrait" applies, unless someone wants to argue that anyone who owns a photo of Brown ''could'' conceivably upload it here under some sort of free license. Wilson is still around, but I think the chances someone will upload a free picture of him anytime soon is pretty slim. And even if 30 years from now someone finally does, it won't do us much good in the meantime plus he won't look anything like he did during the event... which sort of kills the encyclopedic value. I think that since this a historic event (historic meaning this particular event happened at only one time in history), contemporary photos of the main participants are fair use. Thoughts on the validity of "fair-use" here? Thoughts on using the images in general? &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 16:44, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
:For Brown, we get one (and and only one) "fair use" photo under the "dead, no future free photos available" bits of [[WP:NFCC]]. So if consensus can be built on which photo to use, then we can go with it.
:For Wilson, as he is living, we do not get such exceptions. I already uploaded a pic of Wilson's  face injury under the NFCC for a non-reproduceable historical photo that is discussed in the article (the degree of injury or not). Having just an "What does Wilson look like" photo is not going to survive the fair use discussion tho.
:The Trayvon Martin article is working under slightly different rules, because Florida does not allow state agencies to keep copyrights and so all of the evidence stuff is in the public domain. Missouri specifically does allow state agencies to keep copyright.  [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 16:52, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
::That fair use can indeed encompass "what does a main participant look like?" in a very notable "moment in time" event is an incorrect belief? &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 17:30, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
:::Generally only if there is some specific thing that is being commented on significantly in the article that the "moment in time" captures. For example injuries, or "iconic" status. "Here is a random snapshot of Wilson" won't qualify. You can always try of course, but I've seen hundreds of photos trying that argument get deleted. The relevant criteria are [[Wikipedia:Non-free_content#UULP]]. In our case a hypothetical free replacement would let us see the general ID of Wilson just fine (As opposed to the injury photos, which cannot be replaced ever in the future). More detail can be found at [[Wikipedia:Replaceability_of_fair-use_images#Living_people]] [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 17:58, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
::::I'm familiar with the guidelines, just wondering how far they can be stretched in this context. We could argue that not only is this hypothetical future free image of Wilson unlikely to materialize, but it may very well not capture him as he looked during the event. No doubt he'll probably lay low for the forseeable future, he may grow a beard, etc. So one way to look at it is that Wilson, as he was during the event, is in fact a not reasonably replacable historic image. Compare this context with say a movie star with a career that spans many years. If we don't get a picture of him today, he's likely to be out and about still making movies and appearing at events in the future, not to mention his notability is not tied to one particular moment in time. Very different context than Wilson here. I'm not looking for a "you can always try it and see how it goes". I'm looking for a consensus that a "what he looks like" image of Wilson is a valid application of fair-use and while stretching WP guidelines, doesn't necessarily run afoul of them.&ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 18:55, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
:::::Actually, a re-read of [[Wikipedia:Replaceability_of_fair-use_images#Living_people]] (thank-you Gaijin42) makes me think a photo of Wilson is well within the guidelines simply as a "not reasonably replaceable image of a living person". Add to that the idea of his notability being tied to one moment in time, and it's starting to look like a pretty solid case. No? Again, I'm looking for a consensus on that point rather than a "try it and see how it goes". &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 19:25, 8 December 2014 (UTC)

{{u|JBarta}} Regarding your question above about Wilson and replacability, I do not think the photo serves any purpose in the article that qualifies under NFCC. What he looked like in general is not a subject that is discussed in this article. Relative sizes between Brown and Wilson may be relevant, but the photos in question do not show that. Your proposed justification would basically apply to any photo of any person for almost any article, it renders the restriction meaningless. If NFCC had an exception for "this photo has been widely used by news media for this story" I would support that, and would perhaps support a change to NFCC to create such an exception, but as the policy currently stands, I think its pretty clear generic photos of Wilson do not make the cut.

::"What he looked like in general isn't important" could be similarly argued for ''any'' person who is dead, yet has a fair use photo in their article. By my reading of the guidelines, it's not the importance that is important, but whether the photo is reasonably replaceable. If one agrees that a photo of Darren Wilson (especially capturing him at this moment in time) is not reasonably replaceable to an extent similar to a person who has died, then I would think the guideline would apply to Wilson as well as a person who has died. It's not like Wilson is going to be out posing for photos at the next Fergson Community Days or anything. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 21:00, 8 December 2014 (UTC)
:::Wikipedia works in hypotheticals quite often. [[WP:V]] has [[WP:V#Access_to_sources]] for example. (Its in a physical library in Peru in a village only accessible by foot.

(someone catches him in public, federal evidence released, federal charges, cspan testimony) etc.  The main point that its tripping you up on replacability is that you have not stated how a photograph of him at the time is of particular encyclopedic value to justify the copyright issues vs a hypothetical image of him from the future. What does his "look" at that moment in time illustrate for the article? His skin tone? his physical fitness?  We discuss none of this in the article, therefore illustrating  it is not adding anything. In any case, the general policy won't get changed here.

::::On the issue of having a photo of him at this time and its replacabiliy. Imagine for a minute an article about a famous fight between two boxers back in the 1970's. You show each boxer... one a contemporaneous photo, the other forty years later all crippled up hunched over a cane because we can't find a free image of that boxer from back in the 1970s. The article is about the fight in the 1970's. The recent image of the one fighter arguably has little to do with the fight. It's not the same person that was in the fight. The same replacabilty concern exists with Darren Wilson, only the circumstances are less extreme and we're at the beginning of not having an image of him rather than far down the road. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 21:33, 8 December 2014 (UTC)

We have the shot of Wilson's cheek, but that's not equivalent to a full face shot, with eye contact, in the subject's bio section (which I presume is where Brown's photo would go). &#8209;&#8209;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#8E8278;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 21:19, 8 December 2014 (UTC)

* [[User:Jbarta]] asked me to comment here.
: Wilson: This person is still alive. Jbarta seems to be concerned that Wilson may look very different when a free image is created. However, I note that the event took place only four months ago. It is therefore obvious that the person ''currently'' looks more or less the same as he did when this event took place. There is a potential that someone might take a photo of him tomorrow, next week or in January, and that photograph would then serve as a free replacement. It is important to note that [[WP:NFCC#1]] disallows non-free content if free content ''can be created'', and it is perfectly possible to take photos of him for the moment. The image is therefore replaceable, at least for the moment. If, after 40 years, it turns out that there is still no one who has taken a free photo of him, things may be different and he may look a lot different. [[WP:NFCC#1]] allows non-free images in some situations if the person has changed a lot from the time when he became famous, but non-free images are not allowed in all such situations. It may be useful to point out that a similar situation (a child actor active in the 1990s) currently is being discussed at [[Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2014 December 3|deletion review]].
: Brown: This person is dead, so non-free images of him are not replaceable. The image proposed by Jbarta, [http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2014_33/614086/140812-michael-brown-1338_8c5ad41dd423c28ed02e37e39222844e.jpg], looks like an image of children at an amusement park or some similar kind of place. It looks as if Brown could easily be at about the same age as the children in the background. However, it says that he was 18 at the time of his death. Is this a 10-year-old photo or something? If Jbarta is concerned that the photo of Wilson must be contemporary, then why does {{gender:Jbarta|he|she}} think that the photo of Brown doesn't need to be contemporary? I suspect that this photograph isn't suitable for the article. However, I don't know what other photographs, if any, would be suitable. I am also not sure if it is necessary to include a photograph of him in this article per [[WP:NFCC#8]]. I believe that there have been other discussions about murdered people at FFD, but I don't remember the outcome.
: [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin]]: Jbarta mentioned this article because this article also contains non-free pictures.

::And while it's "possible" someone could snap an image of Wilson in the near future and upload free it here, I'd say it's highly unlikely.

Trayvon Martin's photos aren't relevant to the discussion; as of when I wrote this there hasn't been any consensus regarding those images. That leaves Wilson's images. It's possible that a photo of Wilson might be released publicly, so NFCC#1 probably doesn't work here. The only nonfree image that's irreplaceable is that of Wilson's injuries, except they're probably not appropriate for the short biography. Those are better suited for descriptions of the shooting.

== "baseline position" on diagram ==

{{u|Cwobeel}} I think it may be helpful to include a spot on the diagram for the "baseline" position where all the measurements are from. Note that this point is not a [[WP:SYNTH]] issue derived by us from the witness testimony/sources, this is the "zero" point for the diagram measurements, per the crime scene photographers/investigators, and that point is explicitly marked on the original diagram.

As an aside, the quotes below has bearing on the "Crime Scene" discussion above, as we have the police specifically referring to this location as a crime scene.

* [http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/08/the-overlooked-audiotape-of-the-michael-brown-shooting/] (See figure 2 cone photo)

* https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1370513/grand-jury-volume-24.txt
**And why is it that this cone was placed at that location on Canfield Drive? A As best we could tell based off of witness accounts, that would have been the furthest point east that Michael Brown would have went to. So that intersection of roughly Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive. or Canfield Road? [...]That was  the point that they had made reference to and so we used that as the furthest eastern point to go to.
**In terms of on August 9th, one of our crime scene detective's jobs was to '''take various measurements of items of evidence at the scene. And he used what starts as a baseline at Coppercreek Court and Canfield Court, and used this baseline here and measured items during the entire, I should say, within the entire crime scene and those items were documented in a diagram that he completed with specific measurements, feet down to inches.''' So when we went back out there to take those 360 degree panoramic shots, we based, obviously, Coppercreek Court and Canfield Drive is subjective in the sense that we are basing that off of where, again, witnesses were telling us is the furthest point east that Michael Brown would have went So that is a subjective point that we use that intersection, northwest corner of that intersection right there.
* Witness 14 http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/11/24/ferguson-evidence/assets/interviews/interview-witness-14-01.pdf
** "the boy was still standing on the, on the, on the partially on the parking lot and on the grass. 'Cause he had ran that way. The officer came out came around got into his stance. And he said ?stop.? Because the boy looked up at him and he took two steps, about two or three steps.
** When [Brown] turned around he had about one foot on the grass and one on the driveway.

** [Brown] was barely on the sidewalk, he was barely on the  sidewalk to the parking lot. He was going towards this building. I presume that’s the way he was running. He wasn’t really all the way on the driveway when the . . . shot went off, and he turned around, and he was in the street

Can you explain how this is not original research or synthesis? You're converting a not-to-scale diagram to a scale diagram using information from two different primary sources. The article is in poor condition, with many outdated sections, far too many references, and duplicate information in several places. There are also far, far too many statements of the type "A B of XYZ News stated on August 21 that..."

For comparison, [[2014 Grozny clashes]] has a better balance of opinion and fact, and an appropriate use of citations. That's just a random news article that I like the style of.

:About the diagram, as per [[WP:OI]], "Original images created by a Wikipedian are not considered original research, so long as they do not illustrate or introduce unpublished ideas or arguments, the core reason behind the NOR policy." This diagram was created from published data [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/11/24/ferguson-evidence/assets/ferguson/photos/2014-43984/photos-7/picture2.png here] and [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/11/24/ferguson-evidence/assets/ferguson/photos/2014-43984/photos-7/capture.png here], same document.

It can always be improved, but generalizations don't help here. If there are specific things that  you want addressed, join in and do the [[WP:EDITING|hard work]].

== Collaborating, OR, and inline attributions==
Cwobeel, you have mentioned [[WP:OR]] three times since the talk page was last archived, and none of those instances were legitimately original research. I don't think the diagram is OR, actually, but it seemed inconsistent, for example, that you'd estimate the position of the baseline.

I'd like to contribute in a collaborative and positive way, but that will require the active editors to assume competency on my part. I would use fewer in-line citations, I would use primary sources to some extent, and I would have to remove existing content in the process of editing it.

I'm referring to [[WP:BUNDLING]], not to any removal of inline citations or in-text attributions that are required. It didn't occur to me that there was even a possibility of someone thinking I meant removing references that needed to be there.

About consensus: That was in reply to an assertion that I was deliberately removing content. The idea was that it had been there for a long time, and so it should stay. I thought that it needed to be updated, and that's all. If I was really trying to do something incorrect there, I would have undid the revert, and I didn't.

About using primary sources to some extent: I really just meant what I said here (and everywhere else, for that matter). There are aspects of this case where primary sources are the best ones. An example would be the autopsy report, which is the work of a medical professional and makes all of the appropriate conclusions (and none of the inappropriate ones), as opposed to an article about the autopsy.

In general: I don't have a lot of Wikipedia edits, but I've been using the site almost since the beginning. I've written and edited a substantial amount of scientific text, some of which is published. This does not mean I'm better than anyone else, but it's difficult for me to understand the hostility towards my comments here. (I don't mean replies to things that were already hostile.) It's even more difficult to understand the hostility I got when I tried to edit the article.

I have posted to the admin noticeboards incident section. I tried to resolve this with the last post, but all that happened is that I got told I wasn't being collaborative. I can't see any reason why I was being uncollaborative that does not involve altering someone's content.

: I can understand your frustration. Expert editors sometimes have difficulties adapting to the realities of Wikipedia editing. A couple of good essay on the subject are  [[WP:EXPERT]] and [[WP:EXR]] -  [[User:Cwobeel|<span style="color:#339966">Cwobeel</span>]] [[User_talk:Cwobeel|<span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span>]] 20:46, 9 December 2014 (UTC)

The problem with [[WP:PRIMARY]] sources is that they can only be used for "straightforward, descriptive statements of facts that can be verified by any educated person with access to the primary source but without further, specialized knowledge" and "Any interpretation of primary source material requires a reliable secondary source for that interpretation". As can be seen in the "shell casing pattern" discussion above, deciding what is or isn't analysis vs objective fact is often itself controversial per your statement "''Objective facts from a primary source are not original research, and synthesis of objective facts when only one conclusion is possible is not speculation''". Clearly there is disagreement about how many conclusions are possible for almost all the facts of this case both on wiki and in the real world.  Further, your specific example for wanting primary sources is itself problematic "''An example would be the autopsy report, which is the work of a medical professional and makes all of the appropriate conclusions (and none of the inappropriate ones), as opposed to an article about the autopsy''" By definition you are stating that your analysis of the primary source disagrees with the secondary source analysis of that same source. You may be right, you may be wrong, but policy prohibits any such analysis all together. There are plenty of places all of us disagree with various secondary sources, and think they got it wrong. The answer to that is to find an equally reliable secondary source that you think got it right and put it in, not just delete what we disagree with, or put in our own analysis. To some degree those restrictions are less ''on the talk page'' where we can briefly discuss why we think a particular fact or analsysis is relevant and worthy for inclusion in the article.

Please don't be offended by the admin noticeboard post, at least not to a great extent. Things were gradually building up, and I held back from resorting to the admins for a while.

The autopsy report may not be the best example, because that section is okay. I wouldn't analyze a primary source; there is always a need and a place for secondary sources. I just don't think secondary sources are necessarily better. Maybe a witness account is a better example; it could be quoted directly ''and supported by secondary sources'' rather than using several sources to write the account.

== Anonymous released wrong name ==

All right, here's a tricky issue.

I went and tracked down the purportedly-[[Anonymous (group)]]-affiliated Twitter account's release of a police officer's name [[Shooting_of_Michael_Brown#Third_parties|mentioned in the article]], no doubt getting myself on all kinds of governmental watchlists in the process. It's not easy to find, but the name they released was '''not''' that of Darren Wilson. (Nobody type it here!) This fact seems inclusion-worthy despite (or, per [[WP:Recent]], particularly because) being out of the headlines, but the only RS I can find who have reported on this error mention the released incorrect name themselves, and it would be unethical and probably prohibited by [[WP:BLP]] to link to them.

Should we just let this info fade into the Net? People will want to check the record next time Anonymous [[doxing|doxes]] someone in a high-profile situation like this, but maybe that's not our problem.

== More terse summaries in the witness accounts ==

As there are now a massive amount of witness statements available, I think we need to change how we are doing things in the accounts section. Obviously covering each account in the level of detail we currently have for dozens of additional accounts, and then criticisms of those accounts, would not be viable - it would be multiple standalone articles worth of content. Keeping things the way it is now represents an [[WP:NPOV]] issue as well. I suggest we move to a more [[WP:SUMMARY]] style overall bringing all of the media witnesses together under a [[WP:SUMMARY]] section (as they are mostly saying the same thing), and then a Grand Jury section that discusses the various testimonies again at a high level  - Using sources such as the PBS comparison (even with its well known flaws) or the links that {{u|TParis}} pointed out in ANI.

Perhaps the Police/Wilson and Johnson should keep standalone sections, as they are directly involved and therefore their statements have more importance, and have been scrutinized more carefully by the media and other analysts.
[[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 23:26, 9 December 2014 (UTC)

I was saying this, thinking this, and in one case tried doing this, for several days before taking it to ANI. I don't like that I had to take it to ANI because of objections that it would destroy people's work or might constitute original research. There was no critical discussion of any witness that opposed Wilson, and much discussion of discrepancies and flaws in the few accounts that supported it.

I've always thought there should be a section on Wilson's story and a section about the opposing views; I typed that a few days ago, though I'm not sure I posted it. I still think it's the best way to move forward. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 15:49, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

==POV Issues Regarding Controversy Section==

I pretty much agree with everything that TParis wrote at ani. This article has NPOV issues. The article relies too heavily on the opinions of non-notable commentators and their criticism. The article is also littered with weasel words and phrases like "some legal experts" and terms like "asserted" and "claimed", which are all discouraged by MOS. The controversy section for the grand jury hearing is a prime example of undue weight with the amount of criticism in that section. That table really needs to go too, what is the significance of having that, it's not even true. These jurors were a ''typical grand jury'' that were conducting ''typical'' grand jury business, doing exactly everything listed in the first column, before Wilson's case was given to them, there's no mention of that in the table. The criticism in Wilson's section has weasel phrases like "sources reported" and "other discrepancies" without defining who the sources are or what the other discrepancies are. It also provides no context at all either, like the fact that the grand jury was made aware of these inconsistencies before Wilson even testified. There just seems to be a lot of cherry-picking sources to negatively portray Wilson, law-enforcement officers, prosecutors and the grand jurors.[[User:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue"> '''''Isaidnoway''''' </font>]][[User talk:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">'''''(talk)'''''</font>]] 02:10, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:I think the reason for at least one occurrence of "some legal experts" is that the source says "some legal experts". Obviously we can't say it in Wikipedia's voice, so are you suggesting it should be left out of the article because the source declined to identify the legal experts? I would disagree. As for "other discrepancies", if those were elaborated it would be attacked as undue weight, so it appears there's no way to include such material at all. It's either undue weight or weasel words. I'll abstain from discussion about the table for lack of competence in that area. &#8209;&#8209;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#8E8278;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 02:28, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:First, this has almost nothing to do with {{u|Gaijin42}}'s post in [[#More terse summaries in the witness accounts]] and I've refactored it into a new section (if not, go ahead and undo it). I disagree that this article has NPOV issues. [[WP:NNC|Notability does not apply to content]], and we should instead be looking at due weight. In this case, it seems that the majority of opinions are biased against Wilson, the prosecution team and the grand jury, which is why it's reported so heavily in the article; unless it's out of proportion, there shouldn't be anything wrong with this. Sources that argue to the contrary are present; if there are others, they should be included to keep due weight. The "some legal experts" phrase is a leftover from the [http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-ferguson-da-analysis-20141126-story.html LA Times] article, which provided a number of legal opinions. While out of context it may seem like a weasel phrase, the rest of the section references by legal experts mentioned in the source by name, so it really isn't a weasel phrase. Assertions and claims are only weasel words when [[WP:ALLEGED|implying a point is inaccurate]], which is hardly the case here. The table is sourced to NYT, which is why we have it. I don't see what's the problem with having it here, maybe you could clarify? The other two instances are poorly paraphrased: the "sources reported" is actually the Huffington Post's analysis, but the analysis that went into their article was cut out of ours so that'll have to be reworked; there's only one discrepancy reported in the CNN article, so I went ahead and reworded that phrase. At any rate, there doesn't seem to be blatant cherry-picking of POVs as far as I can tell. --[[User:RAN1|RAN1]] ([[User talk:RAN1|talk]]) 03:01, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
::Once you have summarized and presented information to the reader in an encyclopedic tone - following that up with an endless stream of cherry-picked opinions of non-notable commentators is undue piling on. I completely agree that the majority of the reporting is negative against Wilson and the other entities involved in this case, but that doesn't mean we pack as many negative opinions that we can into a section, or the article, and still claim it's NPOV, because that's not neutral. We should be summarizing and including the most notable opinions or academic opinions, instead of being a depository for negative opinions that don't really impart any encyclopedic information to the reader. The weasel phrases "some legal experts" and "sources reported" is exactly that - weasel phrasing - and should never be used in this article, especially when there are more than enough legal experts identified by name offering legal opinions.[[User:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue"> '''''Isaidnoway''''' </font>]][[User talk:Isaidnoway|<font face="Times New Roman" color="blue">'''''(talk)'''''</font>]] 17:36, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
:::I really don't think the opinions are cherry-picked unless we're missing pro-Wilson/prosecutor references, and notability really doesn't matter for sources. I took a closer look at the article though, and I noticed that we're quoting a lot of the opinions directly, which is probably compromising [[WP:IMPARTIAL|impartial tone]]. We should neutrally summarize the arguments instead of quoting them, and I think that should fix the POV problem. Btw, "some legal experts" isn't a [[WP:WEASEL|weasel phrase]] when used in the header or (especially) when the legal experts are clarified after the fact. Using that phrase should be ok.

I don't think there was blatant cherry-picking of POVs, but I think there was a desire to represent a greater variety of opinions than was necessary. There are so many opinions from so many sources that it would be much more helpful to avoid arguing why a given source is acceptable despite having issues like weasel words and unnamed sources. We could simply choose sources that don't do that.

In general, I objected to the inclusion of journalists' opinions about the legal issues because there were also several published opinions from real lawyers about the legal issues. In the point where there was a formal statement from the ACLU and an analysis by the Huffington Post, the first source was a much better choice than the other.

The problem with the table is that it doesn't take into account what grand juries usually do, which is approving felony indictments that a prosecuting attorney's office has already decided to take to trial. The hearing in Wilson's case was intended to determine whether there was sufficient evidence for a trial. (A trial for second degree murder, since it was intentional but unplanned.)
Now, I think this is the time when we got into why it's not up to us to decide when journalists are right or wrong. The table compares two very different things, and in so doing it misrepresents the purpose for the hearing in this case. I don't want to deal with opinions to any more of an extent than is absolutely necessary, but it's not right for Wikipedia to contain information that is factually wrong, or misrepresented, up to the point where one journalist discovers the error of another.

:I think your difference of purpose is the exact point of the criticism. The grand jury was not normal, and thats what the table points out.

And I'd also point out that the table says that they met 25 days over 3 months, that was a decision that this specific GJ themselves elected to do, so that is specific to them and therefore makes it about "the GJ itself" and an apparent scheduling decision they made for convenience purposes. Gee, isn't that controversial?

{{od}} {{u|Isaidnoway}} You are completely misinterpreting the criticism Isaidnoway. Yes, the jury was convened for a set amount of time, but the amount of time they spent on a particular case was controlled by the prosecutor. This same GJ dealt with dozens of cases prior to this case, and most of them were less than a day. Probable cause is a really low standard. Did wilson shoot? Yes. Were there witnesses (that passed the initial "not obviously lying" test)  that said Brown was surrendering? Yes. Ok, thats probable cause for a trial. Impeaching those witnesses, and showing the defensive evidence is the job of the defense, not the prosecutor. Self defense cases are tougher, because they need to show all the elements of the crime and one of those elements is "it wasn't justified" but its still a really low bar. I think there is no way they could get a conviction, but the criticism that the prosecutor would not be giving the random joe the same level of deference is absolutely correct. He used the GJ for political cover instead of just saying "I don't think there is a case here" Political cover is not one of the appropriate roles for a GJ.McCulloch essentially had a trial, where he was both the prosecution and the defense.

They lasted much longer, the prosecutor did not recommend that the defendant be indicted, there was much more evidence presented, many more witnesses testified, the defendant testified, and all of the evidence and testimony was released to the public after the defendant was not indicted.

== On the issues raised on ANI ==

I've posted replies under three sections that dealt with issues raised in the ANI discussion. Now, I'm going to voluntarily avoid this article and talk page for 48 hours, and after that I'll respond to any outstanding issues.

For the editors who have worked on this article and who will be working on it, try to remember that this is one of the increasingly small number of places that people can go to even get a chance at not seeing news presented in the form of a top ten list. Your work is important, people read it, and it needs to be the best it can be. [[User:Roches|Roches]] ([[User talk:Roches|talk]]) 16:35, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

== What gun was used? ==

One of the key missing details is how the police officer's gun was wrested from him. I have tried to find the make and model gun used, as well as the make and model of holster. If this article was merely an overview, I could excuse it, but this article drills down to the level of "$48 worth of cigarillos." Not $47, not $49,but $48. I would like to see the same attention to detail for the gun issue.

Was the gun a Glock, a Smith, etc.? Did the holster have a butt strap, or an internal locking device, etc.?

Thanks for your attention. [[Special:Contributions/50.0.36.243|50.0.36.243]] ([[User talk:50.0.36.243|talk]]) 16:38, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:Not an answer to your question, but a while back I stumbled on this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PR9dAr9vDI YouTube video] that may be informative, or at the very least, interesting. (I'm not suggesting using it as a source nor suggesting the information contained is unimpeachable) &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 16:50, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:It was a .40 cal [[SIG_Sauer_P226#P229]]. Its a 12+1 gun, and Wilson had several spare mags.  To my knowledge we do not know the type of holster he was using, but I don't think its relevant as there is no assertion that Brown went for the gun while it was in the holster - Wilson freely says he drew the gun from the holster himself.  We don't talk about the gun much, because it has not been discussed much in reliable sources.

:One interesting (to me, not covered in any sources I am aware of) discrepancy is that there were 12 cases found near the scene. Wilson states that after the shooting there was one round left in the magazine, which he removed. If there was a round in the magazine, there should also have been a round chambered. That there wasn't means that either there was a [[Firearm_malfunction#Failure_to_feed]] or the remaining bullet was not in the magazine but in the chamber, but wilson explicitly said "I lock the slide back, take the magazine out, take the one round that’s left in it out. I put it all in that bag, seal it with evidence tape and then sign it.".

:: {{yo|Gaijin42}} There are 15 rounds on a P299 magazine, so 12 cases + 1 in the magazine according to Wilson, that leaves two rounds not accounted for? -  [[User:Cwobeel|<span style="color:#339966">Cwobeel</span>]] [[User_talk:Cwobeel|<span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span>]] 23:07, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
:::{{yo|Cwobeel}} The .40 model uses 12-round magazines, it's the 9mm variant that has 15 rounds. --[[User:RAN1|RAN1]] ([[User talk:RAN1|talk]]) 23:11, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:::{{u|Cwobeel}}There are both 10, 12,  and 14 round magazines for a 229.[http://shop.sigsauerguns.com/Magazines_2/P229-Magazines/]  You can see Wilson's specific magazine in the photo at that listverse article I posted, and that it is a 12 round mag. The 14 round mag is longer (duh) so is more difficult to wear while seated. Some cops have the 14 rounders as their backup mags tho since you can move them around more easily than the holstered gun (Wilson said he had 2 additional mags, but their size was not released anywhere)[[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 23:14, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
:::: In my time in the army (not in the US), we used to chamber an extra round in our small arms in addition to the mag. Is that not a practice in law enforcement the US? -  [[User:Cwobeel|<span style="color:#339966">Cwobeel</span>]] [[User_talk:Cwobeel|<span style="font-size:80%">(talk)</span>]] 23:36, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
:::::Yes, that is standard practice here too. Its a 12+1 gun, so the +1 is the "extra". That chambered round would have been the first one fired in the car. Wilson fired 12 times, so the final round should have been chambered in the end, but it could have stayed in the magazine if there was a failure to feed. Per wilson's testimony he also had 2 failure to fires in the car during the time he says Brown's hand was on the gun (see the video posted above for a technical explanation of how his particular gun works in that regard) [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 01:37, 11 December 2014 (UTC)

Also to add to my discrepancy above "locking the slide back" prior to removing the magazine would have loaded the round from the mag into the chamber. (This is why you ALWAYS REMOVE THE MAG FIRST WHEN UNLOADING A GUN) So my assumption is that what he meant to say was that he ejected the round from the chamber and removed the mag, but it was a sloppy way to talk, and I'm surprised nobody (rs) mentioned it, especially with how some sources (Shaun King etc) were saying he might have reloaded, and therefore exactly what happened to each round would be very relevant.

:With the exception of the Travon Martin shooting, all these cases are discussed in news articles as a recent trend of police abuse of force. i.e. Police officers killing people under questionable circumstances.  In fact, there's a good amount of sources that mention them all in the same article.
:The killings in the [[List of killings by law enforcement officers in the United States]] does not single out cases that have produced extensive news coverage and massive national outcry.

::True, but the three deaths that are still in there are related by timing: The grand jury trial against the officer who killed Garner ended in non-indictment last week, and Rice and Gurley's deaths coincided with the grand jury case against Wilson. Brown's shooting at the very least had an influence on the reactions to these, so including them in 'see also' wouldn't be a bad idea. --[[User:RAN1|RAN1]] ([[User talk:RAN1|talk]]) 20:54, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

== Common sense (wiki-linking Ferguson, Missouri) ==

In the opening sentence, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shooting_of_Michael_Brown&oldid=637524325 linked] [[Missouri]], and unlinked "suburb" (edit summary: "some of us don't know where Missouri is; everyone knows what a suburb is"). I was reverted (twice), and instructed to "talk it to talk and stop edit warring". So, I leave it here for others to consider. Thanks. [[User:Signedzzz|zzz]] ([[User talk:Signedzzz|talk]]) 21:15, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

:This is two separate issues, which I will address separately. First, the Missouri linking. I don't know of a policy or guideline about this, but there is [[User:Tony1/Build_your_linking_skills|this essay]] by an editor very experienced with linking. I would encourage any editor to read all of it before becoming involved in any disputes about linking. It says, ''Uniqueness: Is the linked topic reachable—directly or indirectly—through another link in the vicinity? (If so, consider not linking.)'' In other words, [[Missouri]] is easily reachable via [[Ferguson, Missouri]], so it probably doesn't need to be linked here. The general idea is the concept of overlinking, which says that having fewer links increases the value of the remaining ones. That concept is covered in the essay as well as guidelines.

:As to "suburb", I don't think it's all that clear that everyone knows what a suburb is, but I feel less strongly about that. I might even support unlinking suburb on overlinking grounds. Frankly I didn't even notice that was part of what I was reverting. &#8209;&#8209;[[User:Mandruss|<span style="color:#8E8278;">'''''Mandruss'''''</span>]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Mandruss|<span style="color:#AAA;">&#9742;</span>]] 21:27, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
::The idea that it's "overlinking" because the link is available on another article is clearly wrong. (Incidentally, it's only available there because [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ferguson,_Missouri&oldid=637510044 I just added it].) You should always check what your reverting, before accusing editors of edit-warring, (and quoting irrelevant essays and policies).

:::Please don't make statements about what's "clearly wrong" without some kind of backup; i.e., no matter how emphatically you present something as truth, that doesn't make it true. That's fundamental Wikipedia. And please don't lecture me about proper editing procedure while demonstrating complete ignorance of [[WP:BRD]]. The correct procedure was demonstrated in the dispute preceding this one. I was reverted once and I opened a talk discussion about it. You did not do that, instead re-reverting the revert, thereby starting an edit war.

::::Firstly, I started this discussion, not you!
::::Secondly, "overlinking" is best avoided for the reason that it draws attention away from the text. In this case, [[Ferguson, Missouri]] appeared entirely in blue, ie. identically to my edit, so this reason does not apply. And you apparently agree about "suburb". So, we are in agreement, then.

I think [[Ferguson, Missouri]] is fine. No need to link the city and state separately. Regarding [[suburb]], I could go either way. I lean towards not linking it as relatively common knowledge. Then again, I'm from the U.S. If '"suburb" is not a commonly used term in oher English speaking countries then wikilink it. &ndash;&nbsp;[[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta#top|talk]]) 22:31, 10 December 2014 (UTC)

::First, never say "this is my last comment" because it rarely is. There's really no need to... if you're done commenting, just don't comment any more. No need for a parting shot. And if (like so many do) you re-enter the discussion, you re-enter it looking a little silly. We all look silly sometimes accidentally. There's really no need to do it on purpose.

== Washington Post Reception Source ==

''The Boston Post'' source that was used in the reception section has a couple of problems. First, it's actually a repost of ''The Washington Post'', but ''The Washington Post'' doesn't allow the Internet Archive to preserve it. Should it still be sourced to Boston or to Washington? Second, it seems to be a lot of analysis that can't be summed up easily without trimming it out, and doesn't really fit with the reception section and should probably moved next to Wilson's testimony.
