== ''Signpost'' ==

Hey Pat, thanks for writing the ''Signpost'' article, and I apologize for not replying before. As you might be able to glean from my contribs, I've entered graduate school and unfortunately don't have much extra time for Wikipedia. I delayed [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2014-12-10/Op-ed|your article]] by a week as we already had a feature for this week, but it will run next week. With it being an [[op-ed]], you could make it into the first person if you'd like (rather then referring to yourself by your username).

:Just saw the post - thanks, great piece. I'd like to explore opportunities to get the York Museums Trust involved with a Wikidata-focused research project, the proposal for which I am currently [[:d:Wikidata:WikiProject Wikidata for research|drafting]] (see [http://blog.wikimedia.de/2014/12/05/wikidata-for-research-a-grant-proposal-that-anyone-can-edit/ this blog post] for background). --<font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;"> [[User:Daniel Mietchen|Daniel Mietchen]] ([[User talk:Daniel Mietchen|talk]]) </font> 05:22, 13 December 2014 (UTC)

Hello Pat. I was delighted to read the Signpost draft and realise that your work had touched on Sterne (whose lesser novel ''Travels'' inspired a C19 writer I'm fond of). I just love how Wikipedia joins up knowledge. [[User:Roberta Wedge (WMUK)|Roberta Wedge (WMUK)]] ([[User talk:Roberta Wedge (WMUK)|talk]]) 13:12, 9 December 2014 (UTC)

== Bradford request for volunteers ==
Saw this via a BBC news item:-

Thought it might be within the GLAM sphere. [[User:ShakespeareFan00|ShakespeareFan00]] ([[User talk:ShakespeareFan00|talk]]) 12:26, 13 January 2015 (UTC)

==York memorial==
Yes, it's not that I worked on the image, though of course everyone hates to see their work lost. But I think I can overcome that twinge of pain. It was just that the image you added was rather "weird" to look at, as it had some very odd visual 'artefacts', especially at the right (streaks of unreadable shapes); and the base of the sculpture seemed to floating in a void, which gave it a distinctly eerie look. Yes the image was in one sense more useful. It had more visual ''information'' in it, but of course that's not the principal purpose the picture serves in the article. Thanks for the information on other images. [[User:Paul Barlow|Paul B]] ([[User talk:Paul Barlow|talk]]) 11:27, 23 January 2015 (UTC)

Yo maestro, I cannot for the life of my figure out why my new and exciting [[Humber ware]] page auto alphabetises to being under 'Y' in Category:Medieval_Ceramics. Enlightenment? [[User:Zakhx150|Zakhx150]] ([[User talk:Zakhx150|talk]]) 12:34, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
:{{talk page stalker}} {{ping|Zakhx150}} That would be because of the [[Template:DEFAULTSORT]] at the bottom of the page, which currently sorts the page as "York Glazed Ware". [[User:Samwalton9|'''S'''am '''W'''alton]] ([[User talk:Samwalton9|talk]]) 12:37, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
:: {{ping|Samwalton9}} Ah the old 'copy and paste' fail. Cheers chief. Enlightenment acquired. [[User:Zakhx150|Zakhx150]] ([[User talk:Zakhx150|talk]]) 12:40, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
:::Well that was a very relaxing way to sort out a query. :) Cheers {{ping|Samwalton9}}! [[User:PatHadley|PatHadley]] ([[User talk:PatHadley#top|talk]]) 13:08, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
