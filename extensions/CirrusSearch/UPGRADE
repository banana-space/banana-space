This file provides an overview of the CirrusSearch upgrade process.

== General notes ==

It is always a good idea to upgrade index config when deploying a new version.
If your wiki is relatively small this process is extremely fast and can be run
with no downtime:
 php updateSearchIndexConfig.php --reindexAndRemoveOk --indexIdentifier now

If you prefer not to reindex your data make sure to always upgrade the cirrus
metastore by running:
 php metastore.php --upgrade

See the Upgrading section in the README file for more information.

== MW 1.28 (elasticsearch 2.x) ==

If you upgrade from a version prior to MW 1.28 then we must be running
elasticsearch 1.x.  The Cirrus version packaged with MW 1.28 is not
compatible with elasticsearch 1.7.x and you must upgrade to 2.x first.

We strongly suggest to upgrade to elasticsearch 2.3.3 since it's the sole
version fully supported by the wikimedia elasticsearch plugins.

Please refer to https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html

Note: if you use the analysis-smartcn you may encounter a problem that prevents
you from upgrading an existing index to elasticsearch 2.x:
The smart_chinese analyzer was renamed to smartcn, if an existing index uses
smart_chinese then your upgrade process will fail. Please check you index
settings with:
 http://mywiki.url/wiki/api.php?action=cirrus-settings-dump

Or directly with elasticsearch API:
 curl 'localhost:9200/_settings?pretty'

If you find a reference to "smart_chinese" we strongly suggest to start with a
new fresh elasticsearch installation and not try to migrate your data.
