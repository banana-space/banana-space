### Configuration comments
```php
/**
 * List of IP ranges to allow to skip the captcha, similar to the group setting:
 * "$wgGroupPermission[...]['skipcaptcha'] = true"
 *
 * Specific IP addresses or CIDR-style ranges may be used,
 * for instance:
 * $wgCaptchaWhitelistIP = array('192.168.1.0/24', '10.1.0.0/16');
 */
$wgCaptchaWhitelistIP = false;

/**
 * Actions which can trigger a captcha
 *
 * If the 'edit' trigger is on, *every* edit will trigger the captcha.
 * This may be useful for protecting against vandalbot attacks.
 *
 * If using the default 'addurl' trigger, the captcha will trigger on
 * edits that include URLs that aren't in the current version of the page.
 * This should catch automated linkspammers without annoying people when
 * they make more typical edits.
 *
 * The captcha code should not use $wgCaptchaTriggers, but CaptchaTriggers()
 * which also takes into account per namespace triggering.
 */
$wgCaptchaTriggers = array();
$wgCaptchaTriggers['edit']          = false; // Would check on every edit
$wgCaptchaTriggers['create']        = false; // Check on page creation.
$wgCaptchaTriggers['sendemail']     = false; // Special:Emailuser
$wgCaptchaTriggers['addurl']        = true;  // Check on edits that add URLs
$wgCaptchaTriggers['createaccount'] = true;  // Special:Userlogin&type=signup
$wgCaptchaTriggers['badlogin']      = true;  // Special:Userlogin after failure

/**
 * You may wish to apply special rules for captcha triggering on some namespaces.
 * $wgCaptchaTriggersOnNamespace[<namespace id>][<trigger>] forces an always on /
 * always off configuration with that trigger for the given namespace.
 * Leave unset to use the global options ($wgCaptchaTriggers).
 *
 * Shall not be used with 'createaccount' (it is not checked).
 */

# Example:
# $wgCaptchaTriggersOnNamespace[NS_TALK]['create'] = false; //Allow creation of talk pages without captchas.
# $wgCaptchaTriggersOnNamespace[NS_PROJECT]['edit'] = true; //Show captcha whenever editing Project pages.

/**
 * Indicate how to store per-session data required to match up the
 * internal captcha data with the editor.
 *
 * 'CaptchaSessionStore' uses PHP's session storage, which is cookie-based
 * and may fail for anons with cookies disabled.
 *
 * 'CaptchaCacheStore' uses MW's object cache (specifically, MediaWikiServices::getMainObjectStash),
 * which avoids the cookie dependency, but may be fragile depending on the cache backend.
 */

/**
 * Number of seconds a captcha session should last in the data cache
 * before expiring when managing through CaptchaCacheStore class.
 *
 * Default is a half hour.
 */

/**
 * Number of seconds after a bad login that a captcha will be shown to
 * that client on the login form to slow down password-guessing bots.
 *
 * Has no effect if 'badlogin' is disabled in $wgCaptchaTriggers or
 * if there is not a caching engine enabled.
 *
 * Default is five minutes.

 * Allow users who have confirmed their email addresses to post
 * URL links without being harassed by the captcha.
 */

 * Number of bad login attempts before triggering the captcha.  0 means the
 * captcha is presented on the first login.
 */

/**
 * Regex to whitelist URLs to known-good sites...
 * For instance:
 * $wgCaptchaWhitelist = '#^https?://([a-z0-9-]+\\.)?(wikimedia|wikipedia)\.org/#i';
 * Local admins can define a whitelist under [[MediaWiki:captcha-addurl-whitelist]]
 */
$wgCaptchaWhitelist = false;

/**
 * Additional regexes to check for. Use full regexes; can match things
 * other than URLs such as junk edits.
 *
 * If the new version matches one and the old version doesn't,
 * toss up the captcha screen.
 *
 * @fixme Add a message for local admins to add items as well.
