/**
 * Represents a password hash for use in authentication
 *
 * Note: All password types are transparently prefixed with :<TYPE>:, where <TYPE>
 * is the registered type of the hash. This prefix is stripped in the constructor
 * and is added back in the toString() function.
 *
 * When inheriting this class, there are a couple of expectations
 * to be fulfilled:
 *  * If Password::toString() is called on an object, and the result is passed back in
 *    to PasswordFactory::newFromCiphertext(), the result will be identical to the original.
 * With these two points in mind, when creating a new Password sub-class, there are some functions
 * you have to override (because they are abstract) and others that you may want to override.
 *
 * The abstract functions that must be overridden are:
 *  * Password::crypt(), which takes a plaintext password and hashes it into a string hash suitable
 *    for being passed to the constructor of that class, and then stores that hash (and whatever
 *     other data) into the internal state of the object.
 * The functions that can optionally be overridden are:
 *  * Password::parseHash(), which can be useful to override if you need to extract values from or
 *    otherwise parse a password hash when it's passed to the constructor.
 *  * Password::needsUpdate(), which can be useful if a specific password hash has different
 *    logic for when the hash needs to be updated.
 *  * Password::toString(), which can be useful if the hash was changed in the constructor and
 *    needs to be re-assembled before being returned as a string. This function is expected to add
 *    the type back on to the hash, so make sure to do that if you override the function.
 *  * Password::verify() - This function checks if $this->hash was generated with the given
 *    password. The default is to just hash the password and do a timing-safe string comparison with
 *    $this->hash.
 *
 * After creating a new password hash type, it can be registered using the static
 * Password::register() method. The default type is set using the Password::setDefaultType() type.
 * Types must be registered before they can be set as the default.
 *
 * @since 1.24
